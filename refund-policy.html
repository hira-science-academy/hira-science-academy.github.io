  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
  <p>At Hira Science Academy, we are committed to providing high-quality educational content. As our notes and materials are available digitally and free of cost, we generally do not offer refunds for any voluntary donations or payments (if applicable).</p>

  <h2>Free Resources</h2>
  <p>All content, including notes, MCQs, and solved exercises, is offered free of charge. Since there is no purchase involved, the concept of refunds usually does not apply.</p>

  <h2>Donations (If Applicable)</h2>
  <p>If you have made a donation to support our academy and believe it was done in error, please contact us within 7 days. We will review your request and process a refund if found valid.</p>

  <h2>Paid Courses (Future)</h2>
  <p>If we offer any paid services or online courses in the future, we will clearly state the refund and cancellation policy on that product or course page.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this refund policy, feel free to email us at <strong>tayyabgchs@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
